This collection of tutorials covers key econometric concepts and their practical implementation using Python. Each tutorial focuses on different aspects of estimation, hypothesis testing, and model evaluation through simulations and real-world data.

Tutorial 1: Estimation and Properties of Estimators
Objective: Estimate the mean and variance of an unknown distribution using data drawn from a uniform distribution.
Topics Covered:
Estimation of mean and variance
Checking for bias and consistency of estimators
Central Limit Theorem (CLT) verification
Methods: Repeated sampling and plotting to assess estimator properties.



Tutorial 2: Unbiased Estimation and Hypothesis Testing
Objective: Understand and apply unbiased estimators and confidence intervals.
Topics Covered:
Estimation of population parameters (mean and variance)
Hypothesis testing for known and unknown variance
Building 95% confidence intervals for different distributions (Normal, Uniform)



Tutorial 3: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Estimation
Objective: Perform OLS regression on production data and evaluate model performance.
Topics Covered:
Log transformation of Cobb-Douglas production function data
Estimation of coefficients using OLS
Variance estimation and hypothesis testing (t-statistics, Wald tests)
Confidence interval calculation for estimated parameters



Tutorial 4: Advanced OLS and Hypothesis Testing
Objective: Extend OLS methods and conduct comprehensive hypothesis testing.
Topics Covered:
Estimation of parameters and variance using matrix algebra
Calculation of t-statistics for individual coefficients
Construction of confidence intervals
Wald tests for multiple linear restrictions and joint hypotheses



Tutorial 5: Simple Linear Regression and Statistical Inference
Objective: Simulate and analyze simple linear regression with two regressors.
Topics Covered:
Data generation and visualization
Estimation of regression coefficients using the plug-in method
Distribution of estimators and hypothesis testing
Calculation of t-statistics, confidence intervals, and Wald tests
